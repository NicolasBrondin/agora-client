# Agora Chat

Agora chat is an open source location-based chat. 
The vision is to connect people from the same location, to help meet new people, facilitate the communication between people in the same city, neighbourhood or even building.

## Geolocated chatrooms

Agora is based on chatrooms that are linked to a specific location. There can be 5 different levels according to the size of the location.

- Level 0: Earth (Wherever you are, you will always be able to access this chatroom)
- Level 1: Country
- Level 2: City
- Level 3: Neighbourhood
- Level 4: Specific address / Building
